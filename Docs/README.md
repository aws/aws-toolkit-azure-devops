# AWS Tools for Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS)

## Overview

The AWS Tools for Microsoft Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)) adds tasks to easily enable build and release pipelines to work with AWS services and to run commands using the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell module and the AWS CLI.

## User Guide

The [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vsts/latest/userguide/welcome.html) contains additional instructions for getting up and running with the extension.
