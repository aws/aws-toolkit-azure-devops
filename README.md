# Overview

Coverage: [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aws/aws-vsts-tools/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/aws/aws-vsts-tools)

The AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps adds tasks to easily enable build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS) and Azure DevOps Server (previously known as Team Foundation Server (TFS)) to work with AWS services including Amazon S3, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon Simple Queue Service and Amazon Simple Notification Service, and run commands using the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell module and the AWS CLI.

The AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps is available from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-vsts-tools).

This is an open source project because we want you to be involved. We love issues, feature requests, code reviews, pull
requests or any positive contribution. Please see the the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for how to help, including how to build your own extension.

## Credentials Handling for AWS Services

To enable tasks to call AWS services when run as part of your build or release pipelines AWS credentials need to have been configured for the tasks or be available in the host process for the build agent. Note that the credentials are used specifically by the tasks when run in a build agent process, they are not related to end-user logins to your Azure DevOps instance.

The AWS tasks support the following mechanisms for obtaining AWS credentials:

-   One or more service endpoints, of type _AWS_, can be created and populated with AWS access and secret keys, and optionally data for _Assumed Role_ credentials.
-   On Azure DevOps Services, per-build OIDC tokens are also supported for authentication to AWS and always generate temporary credentials for the specified role ARN during authentication to AWS. Please refer to [Creating an OpenID Connect identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for configuring IAM in AWS to support this. The necessary identity provider connection details and role subject name are provided in the build logs for any task using the service connection.
-   If using AWS Access Keys but only the _Assumed Role_ is defined but neither access key ID nor secret key, the role will be assumed regardless. This is useful when using instance profiles.
-   Tasks reference the configured service endpoint instances by name as part of their configuration and pull the required credentials from the endpoint when run.
-   Variables defined on the task or build.
    -   If tasks are not configured with the name of a service endpoint they will attempt to obtain credentials, and optionally region, from variables defined in the build environment. The
        variables are named _AWS.AccessKeyID_, _AWS.SecretAccessKey_ and optionally _AWS.SessionToken_. To supply the ID of the region to make the call in, e.g. us-west-2, you can also use the variable _AWS.Region_. Optionally a role to assume can be specified by using the variable _AWS.AssumeRoleArn_. When assuming roles _AWS.RoleSessionName_ (optional) and _AWS.ExternalId_ (optional) can be provided in order to specify an identifier for the assumed role session and an external id to show in customers' accounts when assuming roles.
-   Environment variables in the build agent's environment.
    -   If tasks are not configured with the name of a service endpoint, and credentials or region are not available from task variables, the tasks will attempt to obtain credentials, and optionally region, from standard environment variables in the build process environment. These variables are _AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_, _AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ and optionally _AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_. To supply the ID of the region to make the call in, e.g. us-west-2, you can also use the environment variable _AWS_REGION_.
-   EC2 instance metadata, for build hosts running on EC2 instances.
    -   Both credential and region information can be automatically obtained from the instance metadata in this scenario.

### Configuring an AWS Service Endpoint

To use _AWS_ service endpoints, add the AWS subscription(s) to use by opening the Account Administration screen (gear icon on the top-right of the screen) and then click on the Services Tab. You can associate a single service endpoint to be used with all AWS tasks in a build or multiple endpoints if you require.

Select the _AWS_ endpoint type and choose if you'll be using AWS Access Keys or Azure DevOps OIDC tokens for authentication.

Azure DevOps OIDC tokens only require a role ARN to be specified. When configuring the AWS Role for use by Azure DevOps Services, ensure that the role trust relationship validates the subject claim provided by the OIDC token. The OIDC Identity provider configuration will validate the issuer and the audience claims. A sample trust relationship for a role:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:oidc-provider/vstoken.dev.azure.com/01EEE488-0907-0612-3813-000012291989"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "vstoken.dev.azure.com/01EEE488-0907-0612-1229-123412341234:sub": "sc://my-test-organization-name/my-test-project-name/my-test-service-connection-name"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

 If using AWS Access Keys provide the following parameters. Please refer to [About Access Keys](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/access-keys/):

-   A name used to refer to the credentials when configuring the AWS tasks
-   AWS Access Key ID
-   AWS Secret Access Key

Tasks can also use assumed role credentials by adding the Amazon Resource name (ARN) of the role to be assumed and an optional identifier when configuring the endpoint. The access and secret keys specified, or a per-task OIDC token rrovided by Azure DevOps Services, will be used to generate temporary credentials for the tasks when they are executed by the build agents. Temporary credentials are valid for up to 15 minutes by default. To enable a longer validity period you can set the 'aws.rolecredential.maxduration' variable on your build or release definition, specifying a validity period in seconds between 15 minutes (900 seconds) and 12 hours (43200 seconds).

**Note** We strongly suggest you use access and secret keys generated for an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user account. You can configure an IAM user account with permissions granting access to only the services and resources required to support the tasks you intend to use in your build and release definitions.
